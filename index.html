    <div class="info"><p><strong class="zard">Step 1:</strong>To a large bowl, add the water, oil, salt, and yeast. Stir, and then add the flour. Mix well.</p>
    <p><strong class="zard">Step 2:</strong>Then knead the dough* for 3 minutes, or until soft and elastic. Add a little more flour as needed if the dough feels too sticky to work with. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature while preparing the filling</p>
    <p><strong class="zard">Step 3:</strong>Cook the potatoes in a large pot of boiling water for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are fully cooked through. Then drain.</p>
    <p><strong class="zard">Step 4:</strong>To a large bowl, add the drained potatoes, green onion, cilantro, chili, ground coriander, salt, turmeric, and pepper. Use a fork or potato masher to mash everything. It's okay if a few lumps remain.</p>
    <p><strong class="zard">Step 5:</strong>Cut the dough into 8 pieces.</p>
    <p><strong class="zard">Step 6:</strong>Roll each piece into a ball with your hands. Dust each ball with flour.</p>
    <p><strong class="zard">Step 7:</strong>Sprinkle some flour on your working surface and use a rolling pin to roll each ball into a thin circle with a diameter of roughly 20 - 22 cm. We're aiming for a thickness similar to that of a tortilla. The thinner the better, but not so thin that it will rip if handled.</p>
    <p><strong class="zard">Step 8:</strong>Before adding the filling, gently lift the rolled-out dough and heavily re-flour your working surface. Spread ⅓ of a cup of the potato filling over half of the dough, leaving a ½ inch (1 cm) border along the edge. Dip your fingers in water and spread the water along this edge, only on one half of the circle.</p>
    <p><strong class="zard">Step 9:</strong>Fold the dough in half, over the filling, to create a half-moon shape. Press out all the air bubbles, then pinch the edges with your fingers to fully seal the bolani.
</p>
    <p><strong class="zard">Step 10:</strong>Add 1 tsp (5 mL) of oil to a large pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the bolani to the pan. Let cook for 2 - 3 minutes or until the bottom is golden. Meanwhile, use a silicone pastry brush to brush some more oil on top of the bolani.</p>
     <p><strong class="zard">Step 11:</strong>When the bottom is golden, flip, and let cook on the other side until golden. Then transfer to a cooling rack.</p>
      <p><strong class="zard">Step 12:</strong>Cut the bolani in triangles and serve with green chutney. Enjoy!</p>

                <p><strong class="zard">Step 1:</strong>Rinse the rice until the draining water is clear. Afterward, let the rice swell in the water for about 2 hours.<br><br>
    <strong class="zard">Step 2:</strong>Cut the onions into small cubes. The meat can be freed from sinews and fat and then cut into bite-sized pieces. Sweat the onions in a hot pan in a little oil. Then add the meat and fry it until brown.<br><br>
    <strong class="zard">Step 3:</strong>In the meantime you can mix the spices with about 500ml of warm water to a spice broth. With this, you extinguish the meat in the pan. Let everything come to the boil and cook the meat for about 1 hour with a closed lid and low heat.<br><br>
        <strong class="zard">Step 4:</strong>While waiting for the meat, you can first cut or grate the carrots into small, very thin sticks.<br><br>
        <strong class="zard">Step 5:</strong>Heat some oil in a large pan and fry the raisins briefly until they swell. Take them out and then fry the carrot sticks in the same oil together with 1 tablespoon of twitch for about 3-4 minutes. Remove the carrot sticks and roast the chopped almonds briefly.<br><br>
        <strong class="zard">Step 6:</strong> As soon as the meat is cooked, take it out of the pan and put it in the oven while it is still warm. Pour the remaining meat stock into a large pot and add the rice. Now let the rice simmer on low heat until all the liquid is absorbed.<br><br>
        <strong class="zard">Step 7:</strong>When the liquid has been absorbed, you can first use a wooden spoon to pierce small chimneys in the rice so that the steam can escape. Now place the warm meat on top and cover it with the carrots, raisins and almonds. Leave everything to simmer for another 30 minutes at very low heat with the lid closed (wrap a clean kitchen towel around it to absorb the steam).<br><br>
        <strong class="zard">Step 8:</strong>To serve, first put the meat on a plate and then layer the rice on top. Finally, add the carrots, almonds and raisins to the rice and serve hot.<br><br>
